The primary goal of Xerxes is to provide a fully customizable and extendable interface to the new generation of commercial discovery systems, including Summon, Primo Central, and Ebsco Discovery.  

Xerxes can also serve as an interface to open source systems like Solr and no-cost services such as the Ebsco Integration Toolkit and the Worldcat API, which can augment (or even serve as an alternative to) commercial discovery services.

The code here is still in an early beta stage, use with caution!
