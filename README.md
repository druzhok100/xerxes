=======================

The primary goal of Xerxes is to provide a fully customizable and extendable interface to:

  1. Commercial library discovery systems, including Summon, Primo, and Ebsco Discovery
  2. No-cost web services, such as the Ebsco Integration Toolkit and the Worldcat API
  3. Federated search systems, including Metalib and Pazpar2
  4. Open source search engines like Solr
