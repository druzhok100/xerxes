The primary goal of Xerxes is to provide a fully customizable and extendable interface to:

  1. Commercial library discovery systems, including Summon, Primo, and Ebsco Discovery.
  2. Open source search engines, including Solr 
  3. No-cost services, such as the Ebsco Integration Toolkit and the Worldcat API
  4. Federated search systems, including Metalib and Pazpar2

There is (or soon will be) code here for all of those systems, but it is still in an early beta stage, use with caution!
